 This is a test project of the Tourmaline Labs API.

 This project is based on the example of [Tourmaline](https://github.com/tourmalinelabs/AndroidTLKitExample)
 
 
 
 The application has two buttons
    
   - The `START SERVICE` button starts the tourmaline service 
    
   - The `START SERVICE IN BACKGROUND` button starts a background service that constantly tries to start the Tourmaline service
